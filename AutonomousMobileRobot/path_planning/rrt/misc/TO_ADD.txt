Add a 'robot'(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tllz7Ox2B3g) that follows the path made by the rrt algoritm and avoids any dynamic obstacle.
Add a way to make the goal of the rrt be the mouse position when clicked.
Add so you can change the goal whenever you desire.
Add space in between the obstacles and the randomly generated nodes so that when the tree starts growing it 
    does not grow very close to the obs, and so the robot when following the path doesnt crash with the obs.

Make a SLAM simulation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GJuEIh4xGo&t=0s) so that the path-finding/planning, mapping, localization, control systems can be tested.
